#PET MATCH


##About the project

  This is my second project from my Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly.

###Requirements overview

  This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack application.** You'll be **building a Sinatra app,** which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

  **This is exciting!** It's a lot, but we'll give you the tools over the next few weeks to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

  **You will be working individually for this project**, and you'll be designing the app yourself. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals â€“ scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

##The Idea

  Pet Match is a web application where pet owners can try to locate pets of the same breed of their pets.

###How to use

  The users will sign up for the service and register their pets.
  After registering, an automatic search is available, that will look for pets of opposite gender in the same city.
  Custom search can also be made looking for the breed and city.
  The same owner can register multiple pets in different cities
